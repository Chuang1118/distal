This website displays the analysis code and results for the paper: 
Single cell profiling of circulating autoreactive CD4 T cells from patients with autoimmune liver diseases suggests tissue-imprinting[@Cardon2024-bv].
Throughout the paper, following previous studies[@Renand2020-jh], focusing on
establishing the link between the self-antigen-specific CD4 T cell response and 
that in the targeted tissue is a difficult and under-researched task in autoimmune liver diseases.

Follow the links below to access the different stages of analysis or refer to
the [Getting started](getting-started.html) page for more details about the
dataset and how to reproduce the analysis.

Analysis
========

* [Figure 2](02-fig2.html) - Single-cell RNA sequencing of 
  liver-self-antigens specific CD4 T cells.
* [Figure 3](05-fig3.html) - Tracking TCR clonotypes between 
  liver biopsies and circulating CD4 T cell subsets.
* [Figure 4](03-fig4.html) - Single cell transcriptomic analysis 
  of unstimulated Sepsecs-specific CD4 T cells.
* [Supplementary figure 2](04-suppfig2.html) - Characterization of 
  the cluster 7 of PDCE2-specific CD4 T cells
* [Supplementary figure 4](06-suppfig4.html) - Literature-based-gene 
  set score analysis of cells from clusters identified in the figure 2F.
* [Supplementary figure 10](05-fig3.html#Supplementary_figure_10) - Single cell gene expression heatmap for
  top 5 marker genes of PD-1+ CXCR5- memory CD4 T cells.
* [Supplementary figure 11](05-fig3.html#Supplementary_figure_11) - Unsupervised azimuth annotation of 
  scRNA-seq data from PD-1+ CXCR5- memory CD4 T cell subsets.
* [Supplementary figure 12](05-fig3.html#Supplementary_figure_12) - Literature-based-gene set score analysis of 
  cells from clusters identified in the figure 3.
* [Supplementary figure 14](07-suppfig14.html) - Literature-based-gene set score analysis 
  of Tetramer positive or negative cells identified in the figure 4.
